ROS - Project2 - TeleOpBot
==========================
ROS tele-operated robot with joystick. Tracked robot with camera, telemetry data connects to 2nd computer with joystick and HUD


Purpose
-------

The purpose of this project was to continue my learning of ROS by creating something more complicated and more robot-like than the previous project. Also I wanted to create a project distributed over more than 1 computer.


Description
-----------

I've always thought that robots look cool with tank tracks so this robot will be using. In addition there will be a camera mounted that can pan and tilt in order to look around. I will be controlling this robot using a joystick connected to my laptop and will view the camera feed on my laptop screen.


Design
------

For tank tracks I used the track and wheel set from Tamiya (http://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/tamiya-track-and-wheel-set.html). The tracks are controlled with this DC motor and gear box (http://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/tamiya-double-gearbox-70168.html) that allow for controlling each track independently.
